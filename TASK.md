The task is:

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC without frontend.

*2 types of users: admin and regular users
*Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
*Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
*Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
*Only one vote counted per user
*Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
